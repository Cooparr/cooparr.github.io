## About
Repo for a simple website I developed to function as a portfolio for myself hosted via GitHub Pages. From viewing the website you can see the iOS apps I have developed, along with the technologies used and courses I have completed on my journey to becoming an iOS developer. 

Additionally, the website is used to host app support & privacy policies for iOS applications I have developed such as TFT Companion.
